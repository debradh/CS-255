Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system designed for its owner, Liam. He wanted the system to provide customers with online classes and practice tests in preparation for the driving exam at their local DMV. The company would also provide on-the-road training.
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a decent job when it came to creating the different UML diagrams. It helped with organization in real life situations but also with organizing steps and processes in my brain.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my GANTT chart if I could. I chose this because I assigned tasks by employee name rather than dates which made the chart much clearer. Plus, it isn’t guaranteed that the employee would still be employed there throughout the project.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by reading through what was being desired in the interview and doing my best to work that into the design. It is always important to consider the user’s needs when designing because they are trying to create something of good quality for their clientele, when all the while, they are YOUR clientele.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When it comes to designing software, I begin by breaking things down into as small as possible for my brain to understand. Then, I take that simplified info and arrange it in other easy techniques and charts. From there, the info sort of comes to life after everything is broken down and then put together.
